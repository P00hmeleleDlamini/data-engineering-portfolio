# M7 SLA Report – ITSM Monthly Executive Dashboard

## 🧠 Overview

The M7 SLA Report is a monthly business-critical dashboard used by SITA executives to track incident management performance. It shows metrics like the number of SLA met vs missed, response times, resolution times, and support group performance — all derived from ITSM incident data.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- SQL Server (T-SQL)
- SSIS (for loading and transformation)
- SQL Server Agent (for job scheduling)
- ITSM Data Tables (e.g., HPD: Help Desk, CTM: People)

## ⚙️ Process Summary

1. Extracted incident data from ITSM landing tables
2. Transformed and cleaned data in the staging layer
3. Loaded into a fact table in the exploitation layer: `FCT_REPORT_SB_ITSM_LAST_INCIDENT10`
4. Built a view to support monthly SLA reporting

## 🚀 Outcome

- Reduced manual reporting effort by 90%
- Ensured on-time delivery of monthly executive reports
- Created a reusable ETL pipeline that can be scheduled via Agent jobs
